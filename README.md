# Covid-vaccine-scheduler
My final project for my CSE 414 class.

## How to run:
You need to have an environment on your computer that can run Python.

If you're currently in this environment, all you need to do is run the Scheduler.py in either
your editor of choice or in the commmand line and then you can try the program yourself!

## What it does:
It is a covid vaccine scheduler that allows patients and caregivers to make accounts and than request
vaccine appointments using SQL and Python. Any accounts made, the current availabilities of caregivers, vaccine doses and the scheduled
appointment are all stored on the cloud in a Microsoft Azure database. For the account creation process there is a salt
and hash encoding made to protect againest possible leaks.
